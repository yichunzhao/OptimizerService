# OptimizerService

## Problem
The project is to build a Rest-API for solving knacksnack problem. The job is carried out in an asynchronouse communication.
It means that a client may post its task in the sever, and get back its solution later on.  

## Technique
Techniques are applied, i.e. **Spring Boot 1.5, Hibernate-JPA, Java 8, Derby(memory database), PostgreSql database, Heroku as PaaS, Maven, Git**. 

## Knapsack Algorithm
I slightly changed [Java Program to Implement Knapsack Algorithm](http://www.sanfoundry.com/java-program-knapsack-algorithm/), so that it fits into the project. 

*The reason why I didn't use Google solver:* 
1) It is not included in the Maven repository 2) I found it in a third party repository, and its maven dependency; however, it can not be included in both compling and runtime scope. Google solver constains dll file for interfacing with Java, which is required in runtime. 3) I believe it has a solution in somewhere, but I can't stuck here right now. So, I decide to take the current solution. 

## Architect
From bottom to top, code follows a structure, i.e.
database(derby for dev., postgresql for cloud) -> entities and data model-> repository(DAO) -> service(business logic) -> controller(http request handler)

## Concept
User post its task via API. System feedback a htttp accepted status, meanwhile spawning a new thread to do the heavy job. As the job done, the solution is inserted in to database, waitting for user to retreive it. 

## Deployment
Cloud: https://knapsacksolver.herokuapp.com/ Â  
Project jar file is deployed on the Cloud via Heroku CLI using git command. 

or 
Local: http://localhost:8080
running on Tomcat sever

## Security
API is secured by the Spring Security, with user: "test" and password: "test"

## Testing 
Unit test: Spring Intergration test with Mocked MVC. It includes an emabeded memory database, and a mocked application server.
It is presented in the code, test package. 
And/OR: 
Real life test: using Postman to invoke APIs. 

## APIs
### Create a task in the sever to calculte (http Post method)
URI: https://knapsacksolver.herokuapp.com/knapsack/tasks

Request body: {"capacity":60,"weights":[50,10,20,40,30],"prices":[300,60,90,100,240]}

Basic Auth.: user: "test"; password: "test"

### Check a task status by task id (http Get method)
URI https://knapsacksolver.herokuapp.com/knapsack/tasks/id

id : Long ; task id.

### Get back a solution ref. to task String (http Get method)
URI https://knapsacksolver.herokuapp.com/knapsack/solutions/task

task: JAVA util UUID String ; achieved when posting a task

for instance: https://knapsacksolver.herokuapp.com/knapsack/solutions/0964614d-b8fb-450e-9abd-fcace74dabe9

### Get tasks classified by status (http Get method)
URI https://knapsacksolver.herokuapp.com/knapsack/admin/tasks

return all tasks classified by their status. 

for instance
